# PMF
***This is a python code for probabilistic matrix factorization using SGD update rules in recommendation.***

***All files are organized and they are easy to be understood***

***You can use movielen-1m for testing this code. Please note the data path in this code are all relative path.***

The files are following:
===>1. generate_data.py
Generate data for pmf_main.py file
===>2. pmf_main.py
The main file of pmf algorithm, define some hyper-parameters.
===>3 pmf_model.py
This file contains the main pmf model definition.
===>4 evaluations.py
This file defines the evaluation metric way for this algorithm.(RMSE in this file)
